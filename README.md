The patch adds a **Patch Settings** entry above VSCO's Settings menu with:

- Original-quality image and DSCO downloads to a remembered folder.
- Optional username subfolders, filename templates, and timestamp control.
- Tracking-clean copy-link and share-original actions.
- A long-press, full-quality profile-photo viewer with a save action.
- Toggles for profile buttons/badges, suggested users, membership prompts, and promotional cards.
- Video autoplay and unmute controls.
- Selective usage-analytics and marketing-attribution blocking.

Filename templates support `{id}`, `{username}`, `{type}`, and `{timestamp}`.
Location is never used in filenames or folder organization.

## Build

1. Install Java 21 and Android SDK Platform 36.
2. Add a GitHub token with `read:packages` to your user-level Gradle properties:

   ```properties
   gpr.user=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
   gpr.key=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```

3. Run:

   ```powershell
   .\gradlew.bat buildAndroid
   ```

The patch bundle is written to `patches/build/libs/`.

## Releases

The included workflows publish prereleases from `dev` and stable releases from
`main`. Use semantic `feat:` and `fix:` commits so the release workflow updates
the bundle metadata, changelog, and patch list automatically.
